PuTTY palette generator â€“ A tool to easily create custom colour palettes for PuTTY

Putpagen has been created to address a difficult process of configuring colours
in PuTTY program. You surely know how unreadable is the default blue colour on
black background. To change it you have to do the following steps:

- R-click
- Click "Change Settings..."
- Click "Colours"
- Scroll down the list
- Choose "ANSI Blue"
- Change the colour
- Click "Apply"
- Evaluate your modification. Let's assume that you're still not happy with
  the look. So again:
- R-click
- Click "Change Settings..."
- Click "Colours"
- Scroll down the list
- Choose "ANSI Blue"
- Change the colour
- Click "Apply"
- Evaluate your modification

And this is only a modification of a single colour. When you want to design
a custom palette by changing a lot of default colours, the process becomes
really long.

With putpagen, ok, first you have to open it. But when it's opened, the cycle
of changing and evaluating the result is much shorter:

- Choose a colour from the list
- Change the colour
- Evaluate your modification. Not happy? So again:
- Change the colour
- Evaluate your modification.

With putpagen you can:
- Design your custom nice looking palette much quicker than using just PuTTY
  settings.
- Quickly evaluate your palette in the preview window.
- Update PuTTY with your settings with just a single click, so that you can
  evaluate your palette in a real life situation.
- Export your settings to a registry file, so that you can easily deploy it
  somewhere else.
